**INTRODUCTION**
----------------

Telecom Design’s **TD1207** devices are high performance, low current
SIGFOXTM gateways. The combination of a powerful radio transceiver and a
state-of-the-art ARM Cortex M3 baseband processor achieves extremely high
performance while maintaining ultra-low active and standby current
consumption. The **TD1207** device offers an outstanding RF sensitivity of –
126 dBm while providing an exceptional output power of up to +14 dBm with
unmatched TX efficiency. The **TD1207** device versatility provides the
gateway function from a local Narrow Band ISM network to the long-distance
Ultra Narrow Band SIGFOXTM network at no additional cost. The broad range
of analog and digital interfaces available in the **TD1207** module allows any
application to interconnect easily to the SIGFOXTM network. The LVTTL low-
energy UART, along with the numerous GPIOs can control any kind of
external sensors or activators. Featuring an AES encryption engine and a
DMA controller, the powerful 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 baseband processor can
implement highly complex and secure protocols in an efficient environmental
and very low consumption way.
