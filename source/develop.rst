Developing guide
----------------

This guide will provide instructions to install the development environment needed to compile and debug the demo firmware of the Sensor Node Sigfox. The development system is multiplatform, it supports Windows and Linux. This guide is written using Windows.
The main steps are:

- Install Kinetis Design Studio

- Import build & debug the source project

Hardware required:

- Sensor Node Sigfox with battery or Mini-USB cable

- Segger J-Link (`Segger website <https://www.segger.com/jlink_base.html>`_) with SWD debug interface

- PC with Windows or Linux

Install & Update Kinetis Design Studio
**************************************

First up, register at the NXP website `registration form <https://www.nxp.com/webapp/crcl.ccr_register.framework?ACTION_TYPE=registerpage>`_ then you can download the IDE from `this page <http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/run-time-software/kinetis-software-and-tools/ides-for-kinetis-mcus/kinetis-design-studio-integrated-development-environment-ide:KDS_IDE>`_. Press on **Download** button.

We used Kinetis Design Studio **3.0.0**, click on **Previous** tab and then on **Downloads for Kinetis Design Studio for Microsoft Windows**. 

.. image:: _static/download_kinetis_1.jpg

Agree the terms and download the file **Kinetis Design Studio installer for Microsoft Windows 3.0.0.exe**.

.. image:: _static/download_kinetis_3.jpg

Next, launch the downloaded file **Kinetis Design Studio installer for Microsoft Windows 3.0.0.exe** following all the default options. During the installation will be installed also **PE Drivers** from Jungo LTD.

Launch KDS and select a directory for the workspace. Our project will be imported in this folder. In this guide we used this path:

.. image:: _static/kds_workspace.jpg

subsequently, update the system on **help->check for updates**. Check the box showed below and press **Next** button.

.. image:: _static/kds_update1.jpg

then accept the terms od the license agreements and click on **Finish**.  All the updates available will be installed, accept some request during the installing if it is required. At the end restart the IDE.

Now we have to update the Kinetis Design Studio to version **3.1.0**, from `this page <http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/run-time-software/kinetis-software-and-tools/ides-for-kinetis-mcus/kinetis-design-studio-integrated-development-environment-ide:KDS_IDE>`_, Press on **Download** button.

8. Close Preferences windows by clicking on OK button.
9. Select Help -> Check for Updates
10. Continue with the wizard. Accept the license agreement during the installation process.
11. Restart KDS

At his point, if you want to modify the project using **processor expert** it is required to install also the package KSDK 1.3.0 because with the installation of the Kinetis Design Studio 3.0.0 it is installed the KSDK 1.2.0 version and it is not compatible with the project. You can find this package on `KINETIS-SDK page <http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/run-time-software/kinetis-software-and-tools/development-platforms-with-mbed/software-development-kit-for-kinetis-mcus:KINETIS-SDK?code=KINETIS-SDK&nodeId=0152109D3F1E8C1EF7&fpsp=1&tab=Design_Tools_Tab>`_. Select Download button from **Kinetis SDK**.

.. image:: _static/download_kinetis_KSDK_1.jpg

Select **KSDK v1.3.0 Mainline releases**

.. image:: _static/download_kinetis_KSDK_2.jpg

Agree the terms and then download **Kinetis SDK 1.3.0 Mainline - Windows.exe**

.. image:: _static/download_kinetis_KSDK_3.jpg

Install it following all the default options, it will be installed into **C:\Freescale\KSDK_1.3.0**

Follow these steps:
1. Run KDS 3.0.0
2. Select Help -> Install New Software
3. Click on **Add...** button
4. Then click on **Archive** button
5. Now select from **C:\Freescale\KSDK_1.3.0\tools\eclipse_update** the file **KSDK_1.3.0_Eclipse_Update**
6. Select the package **KSDK 1.3.0 Eclipse Update**
7. Continue with the wizard. Accept the license agreement during the installation process.
8. Restart KDS

Now you are ready to import the project in your KDS.

Import Project
**************

Go to **File->Import** and select **Existing Projects into Workspace**.

.. image:: _static/kds_archive.jpg

Browse to the zip file containing the project and select the project.

.. image:: _static/import_sigfox.jpg

Press on **Finish**. Now you are ready to build and debug it.

Build & Debug via SWD
*********************

Go to **Project->Build All**, to compile the entire project. In order to debug it connect the J-Link to the connector **CN4**. The used debug interface is **SWD**. Then turn on the board switching the **SW1**.

.. image:: _static/board_jlink.jpg

Always on the KDS click on **Run->Debug Confiuration->GDB Segger J-Link Debug**.

.. image:: _static/kds_debug.jpg

Clicking on **Debug** button the debug will start entering on the first line code of the **main()** function. During the debug session the sleeping mode doesn't work.

Build & Debug via USB
*********************

With the USB connector you are able to use OpenOCD inteface. In order to use it download and install the drivers for windows at `mbed website <https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration>`_, 

.. image:: _static/download_mbed_driver.jpg

Go to **Project->Build All**, to compile the entire project. For debug it connect the USB mini from the PC to the connector **CN2**. The used debug interface is **OpenOCD**. Then turn on the board switching the **SW1**. Windows will recognize the board as a mass storage.

Always on the KDS click on **Run->Debug Confiuration->Sigfox_Debug_OpenOCD**.

.. image:: _static/kds_debug_openocd.jpg

Clicking on **Debug** button the debug will start entering on the first line code of the **main()** function. During the debug session the sleeping mode doesn't work.

Processor Expert
****************

KSDK 1.3.0 is a graphic tool used to simplify the peripherals initialization of the MKL26Z microprocessor. We suggest you to install the 1.3.0 version if you want to change the source code. This project is bare metal.
